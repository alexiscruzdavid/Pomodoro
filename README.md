	#1. *Clearly state what track you're submitting to*
We are submitting to the Education track.

	#2. Inspiration
Our inspiration was the Pomodoro Technique video on youtube. The already existing Pomodoro technique on youtube does not have much customization at all, including customizable times for how long you want to study and how long you want to have your breaks, our project aims to solve that problem.

	#3. What it does
What our project does is that you can customize how you study. There is a customizable timer where you can set the length of your study time, and the length of your breaks, during your breaks you can watch a video, and during your study sessions you can play background sounds, whether it be the pre-set sounds we have added or your own custom music/sounds it is completely customizable. 

	#4. How we built it
We built the project on Dreamweaver using a combination of the languages HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

	#5. Challenges we ran into
The challenges we faced were we had many ideas we wanted to implement such as being able to upload your own custom-made presets and share them with others, being able to customize the look of your timer, having a feature that gives you a warning if you try and leave the timer page while the timer is still going on, and many more features. Due to our team's combined limited knowledge of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, we were unable to implement all of the features we wanted and had to narrow down the scope of our project multiple times to focus on what we are able to create. Many times our team wanted to give up but we pushed through and did many sacrifices to present the project we have today. 

	#6. Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of what we have accomplished as a team of Sophomores at our very first Hackathon at Duke. Many of us before this experience had limited knowledge of making websites, and by the end, we have so many new skills whether it be designing and prototyping on Figma, coding in the various new languages we have learned, working as a team to solve problems, to learning how to use DreamWeaver, this experience was amazing for our learning with the cherry on top being a working prototype we are able to present.

	#7. What we learned
We learned so much from this experience from being able to collaborate as a team while effectively communicating to accomplish the tasks at hand, and learning to use languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Learning how to design on Figma and get our ideas from being an idea to a working prototype. Learning how to use DreamWeaver to create everything we want to create. 

	#8. What's next
What's next is that after this Hackathon we plan on finishing this project, and eventually implementing all the features we werenâ€™t able to implement during the Hackathon. We also plan on making the project more aesthetically pleasing and adding so many more things.
